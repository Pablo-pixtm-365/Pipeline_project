<h1>Pipeline Project</h1>

<h2> Introduction</h2>

There exist many ways to work with data, from small data and big data.<br>
There is not an specific tool that we can use to work with and many approaches and methods to deal with. <br>
In this case, as a part of our Schoolar Project and course we saw many tools, and many methods. We decided to work with Spark, Mongo, Python and Bokeh. <br>
The project is divided in many past, starting from Data Adquisition, pre processing, built of the model, prediction and visualitation. <br>
The objetive of this project is to answer the following questions: 
* What are the most likely places where an earthquake could occur in 2017?
* Is there a big difference in the number of earthquakes that have occurred during the years from 1965 to 2016?
* Are there any incremental changes in the average magnitude of earthquakes over the years?
<h2>Justification</h2>
<h3> Pipeline</h3>

* Data Source: 
  * We took the useful earthquakes'data set (1965-2016) from **Kaggle**. <br>
  We use 
* Data Acquisition:


* Data Cleaning


* Data Storage
